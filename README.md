EHR DATA ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
Researchers are using EHR data and machine learning techniques to predict adverse outcomes in healthcare. However, preprocessing EHR data for ML tasks is complex due to its messy nature, high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and missing values. Open-source frameworks have been developed to simplify data preparation for hierarchically multimodal EHR data. These frameworks are generalizable across prediction times, ML algorithms, and data sets, and robust to user-defined arguments settings. They are effective in low-resource clinical settings but have limitations, such as computational inefficiency.
